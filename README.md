![A preview of the hyperterm-hyperspace colour scheme](https://github.com/colepeters/hyperterm-hyperspace/raw/master/screenshots/screenshot1.png)

[Hyperterm](https://hyperterm.org) theme based on [nashamri/spacemacs-theme](https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-theme), the default colourscheme for Spacemacs. If you use Neovim, also check out [colepeters/spacemacs-theme.vim](https://github.com/colepeters/spacemacs-theme.vim).

Note that the active tab and cursor colours defined in this scheme deviate somewhat from Spacemacsâ€™ colours, using a violently hot pink because I think it looks p dope. YMMV.

## Usage
Add it to your list of Hyperterm plugins:

```js
plugins: [
  'hyperterm-hyperspace'
]
```
